# ExoHabitAI 🌌

## 🚀 Project Description
ExoHabitAI is an AI-based system designed to predict the habitability potential of exoplanets using planetary and stellar parameters. The system analyzes attributes such as orbital period, semi-major axis, planetary radius, stellar temperature, and luminosity to determine whether a planet could potentially support life.

This project integrates Machine Learning with a Flask-based web application to provide real-time predictions and a visual dashboard.
